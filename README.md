HW5_SIMPLE_DAY_PLANNER

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Using CSS, HTML and JS I created a functioning day planner. Here are some demo pictures

The day planner can be saved, and info in there if not saved and the page is refresh will automatically dissapear. 
If you want to test the dynamic CSS element if not at time frame from 9am to 5 pm, please subtract from 5-10 depends on your time zone.
